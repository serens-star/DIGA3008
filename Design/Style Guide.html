            I've attached a style guide I made using Amber's Coopers template
            that was found on Canva. In it I had included a vision for my colour
            scheme, as well as my font type and the type of imagery I want to
            include. In my head I envisioned my website to have a lot of heavily
            artistic and maximilistic images and art. I want it to look vibrant,
            yet cohesive, hence the consistent colour scheme

        <h2>Input Controls:</h2>
        <p class="Information">
          I decided to add a section for my interface in my style guide, where
          it shows what I would like my buttons would like to look like. I
          wanted my interacitve elements to be very clearly highlighted with the
          hover tool and the use of colour.
        </p>
        <h2>Navigational Components:</h2>
        <p class="Information">
          I included a navigation bar (made using href links) that will take the
          viewer from one page to another. I also added a return button at the
          bottom of my pages so viewers are able to return to the previous page,
          when on another page.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Components:</h2>
        <p class="Information">
          I really enjoy the idea of having an animated loading screen when
          people open the home page.
