    WEEK 1 - BLOG POST
    My experience setting up my GitHub was relatively easy, seeing as I already have a GitHub 
    account and I have experience committing my work onto a repository from last year. What I 
    did have trouble with was adapting that knowledge to a new software like Visual Studio
    Code. Though we did get a step by step guide on how to get Visual Studio Code set up, I did 
    feel out of my depth trying to get used to how this software works, and getting familiar with
    the new coding language and its layout. Having a tutor walk me through the whole process
    again and showing me where I went wrong, definitely made the whole process a lot easier
    and faster. I feel a lot more comfortable with committing my changes for VSCode to Github now.
