                Littered with Ads
                    Anytime you click on anything an ad pops up
                    The website is very overwhelming/overstimulating
                    There isn't much cohesion and the excessive amounts of ads does not make it any easier to navigate. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="title"> Pros</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    They have created a space where all the creative South African websites can be found in one space
                    This would make finding a very niche website so much easier.

                        The Interface is organized
                        Making it easy to find whatever it is you're looking for 
                        The Images are clearly labelled 
                        Consistent nav bar
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="title"> Cons</h3>
                    <p class="description">
                        I just think if its a space for showcasing south african creative, they could've played around with the animations & other stylistic design choices a little bit more
                    </p>

                            Interactive/visually appealing interface
                            I think the use of animation on the images, elevated the website
                            I love how consistent & cohesive the colour scheme of the website is 
                            Though the website has a lot of information it does not feel cluttered or overwhelming to navigate

                            Hard to find
                            Its at the very bottom of the google search 
                            Making it hard for people to find a website that's as great as this
