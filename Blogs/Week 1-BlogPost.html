          <h2>My Experience Setting Up GitHub</h2>
          <p>
            My experience setting up my GitHub was relatively easy, seeing as I
            already have a GitHub account and I have experience committing my
            work onto a repository from last year. What I did have trouble with
            was adapting that knowledge to a new software like Visual Studio
            Code. Though we did get a step by step guide on how to get Visual
            Studio Code set up, I did feel out of my depth trying to get used to
            how this software works, and getting familiar with the new coding
            language and its layout. Having a tutor walk me through the whole
            process again and showing me where I went wrong, definitely made the
            whole process a lot easier and faster. I feel a lot more comfortable
            with committing my changes for VSCode to Github now.

          <h2>Reflecting on the Readings</h2>
          <p>
            One of the readings I had selected was “Flash and its History on the
            Web” by Jay. This article was particularly very interesting, to me,
            as someone who’s been on the internet for as long as I can remember.
            I did not expect to be so enthralled in the history of the internet,
            especially when the article was about a random software platform
            I’ve never heard of before. Upon reading it further, I came to
            realise how much of what piqued my interest, as a child and even as
            an adult, about the internet and technology itself was somehow
            connected to Flash’s software platform. The article mentioned how
            FutureWave’s (Flash) ‘first target was [...] computers you could
            operate with a pen or stylus’ and that brought me back to when I was
            introduced to a stylus for the first time. This was probably the
            early 2010’s because I could have sworn my mom still had her
            Blackberry; I had just seen a commercial on the TV about a brand new
            phone with a stylus and I instantly fell in love. After months of
            begging my parents to get me one, they eventually caved and, I would
            not put that stylus down, it was like the best thing to ever exist,
            as far as I was concerned. I grew up and my sentiment has not
            changed about the stylus. It is quite interesting how time periods
            play a role in the success of technology because after FutureWave
            took 2 years to build out SmartSketch and the pen computer, it had
            lost all its popularity by 1995, but 10 years later, other software
            companies are gaining popularity from what Flash had started.

          <h2>Interesting Things Found on the History of the Web</h2>
          <p>
            An interesting thing I learnt about the history of the internet was
            actually from this article. I learnt that so much of the internet,
            that we know today, was connected to Flash’s multimedia software
            platform. Knowing how Flash’s development was practically built in
            tandem with the web is very surprising to me, seeing as I’ve never
            heard about Flash and its influence on the internet in the late 90’s
            to early 2000’s , until right now. Something I found particularly
            fascinating was the fact that YouTube used to be a dating site. The
            fact that Rabois (an investor for Karim’s own video uploading and
            streaming service) had to “convince[...] the YouTube team to drop
            their silly dating site pretenses and focus on [...] uploading and
            streaming videos.” is especially funny to me.

          <h2>Goals For the Course</h2>
          <p>
            I have a couple of goals for this course. One being for my website
            portfolio to be an extension of my creativity. I want whatever
            vision I have, to be well executed to its fullest extent. Another
            goal of mine is to stay on top of the coursework, and not fall
            behind to the point where I’m rushing to do things at the last
            minute. The last thing I want is to have my work be rushed and for
            my intended vision to fall through because of my bad time
            management. I would also like to become a better writer and for my
            writing to be engaging. I want to articulate myself better, be able
            to unpack interesting topics in a way that shows I have understood
            the topic being discussed and for me to confidently make my points.
