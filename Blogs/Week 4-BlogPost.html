          <h2>My Journey With HTML Structure:</h2>
          <p>
            The initial phases of me working through my website, using HTML was
            fairly easy. This was in part due to the fact that I had kept up
            with the tutorial and lectures on how to go about setting it up,
            this made structuring the bones of the website a lot simpler. The
            more challenging aspect of working with HTML came when delving
            deeper into the functionality of the website and making sure
            everything was working correctly. This is where I got critiques on
            my structuring, and the functionality of my links (or lack thereof).
          </p>

          <h2>What I've Struggled With:</h2>
          <p>
            Something that I found was a huge struggle when working on my
            website, were my links. Specifically the links to the index/home,
            and blog home page. This was particularly scary to have to deal with
            seeing as they are a huge part of the website and if viewers cannot
            access my homepage, there is no website; similarly if they cannot
            access my blog home page they would not be able to view the contents
            of my blog posts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think this problem came about because initially, when I was
            setting up these links, I would only check their functionality
            through Live Server and not through my GitHub Repository. This gave
            me the impression that everything was working fine, additionally
            when starting out, I had no real understanding of root folders and
            how they worked. Meaning that I had failed to include the required
            folder when inserting the links.
          </p>

          <h2>IxD Process:</h2>
          <h3>Discovering User Needs:</h3>
          <p>
            Being aware of user needs has helped me structure my website more
            efficiently. Knowing what I would like users to do or see in my
            website, ensures that I included information that was relevant to
            their needs.
          </p>
          <h3>Developing the Framework:</h3>
          <p>
            The way I kept user experience in mind when developing my framework
            was by making sure that I had well structured pages. I ensured that
            my work would be able to be picked up by the crawlers and I did this
            by ensuring that I had included as much microformats and metadata as
            possible. This I feel would make finding my website easier, and it's
            clear formatting would make it easier to navigate.
          </p>
          <h3>Refining the Exprience:</h3>
          <p>
            The way I chose to refine my user experience was by ensuring that I
            had a well organized website. I wanted to ensure that all the
            related work had been grouped together. I believe that the structure
            of a website plays an important role in user experience, I think as
            soon as a website gets confusing that is when users leave.
          </p>

          <h2>What I'm Proud of:</h2>
          <p>
            What I’m most proud of when it comes to my webpage is, admittedly,
            my blog page section. I’m very pleased with the way it is structured
            and how organized it is. I’ve added a return link within each blog
            post, that takes the viewer back to the Blog Home Page. I learnt
            about entities and used them for the arrows for the Return button.
            I’ve put a lot of thought and implemented a lot of my knowledge from
            class when building this section, and seeing all of that work
            present in these pages makes me really excited to see how it’ll look
            once I add other stylistic elements to it.
          </p>

          <h2>Change for the Future</h2>
          <p>
            I plan on implementing a more structured navigation bar. As of right
            now I feel as though my navigation is lacking in a lot of elements
            and like it isn’t really structured in a way that will help viewers
            efficiently navigate through my website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing that I would like to add onto my website is a lot more
            descriptions, especially on the Home Page, I feel like it would add
            a lot more personality to the website and for it to feel more
            personalised, along with that sent iment, I think adding more images
            would help in achieving that goal
          </p>

          <h2>What I'd Like do Moving Forward:</h2>
          <p>
            Working on the structuring of HTML has taught me a lot of background
            knowledge on the importance of semantic markups and what it means
            for a website to be functional. What I’m excited about in the future
            is working with CSS. I'm looking forward to implementing a
            consistent colour scheme throughout my website, in order to bring
            more life and personality to my website. I think this would help
            elevate the website and help it move away the very structured look
            that HTML gives. Another thing I’m looking forward to when working
            with Java Script is adding animations and scroll buttons to my
            website. I think this would really help make the website a lot more
            interactive
