    <h2>My Journey With HTML Structure:</h2>
    <p>
      The initial phases of me working through my website, using HTML was fairly
      easy. This was in part due to the fact that I had kept up with the
      tutorial and lectures on how to go about setting it up, this made
      structuring the bones of the website a lot simpler. The more challenging
      aspect of working with HTML came when delving deeper into the
      functionality of the website and making sure everything was working
      correctly. This is where I got critiques on my structuring, and the
      functionality of my links (or lack thereof).

    <h2>What I've Struggled With:</h2>
    <p>
      Something that I found was a huge struggle when working on my website,
      were my links. Specifically the links to the index/home, and blog home
      page. This was particularly scary to have to deal with seeing as they are
      a huge part of the website and if viewers cannot access my homepage, there
      is no website; similarly if they cannot access my blog home page they
      would not be able to view the contents of my blog posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this problem came about because initially, when I was setting up
      these links, I would only check their functionality through Live Server
      and not through my GitHub Repository. This gave me the impression that
      everything was working fine, additionally when starting out, I had no real
      understanding of root folders and how they worked. Meaning that I had
      failed to include the required folder when inserting the links.
