    <h2>My Journey With HTML Structure:</h2>
    <p>
      The initial phases of me working through my website, using HTML was fairly
      easy. This was in part due to the fact that I had kept up with the
      tutorial and lectures on how to go about setting it up, this made
      structuring the bones of the website a lot simpler. The more challenging
      aspect of working with HTML came when delving deeper into the
      functionality of the website and making sure everything was working
      correctly. This is where I got critiques on my structuring, and the
      functionality of my links (or lack thereof).
    </p>

    <h2>What I've Struggled With:</h2>
    <p>
      Something that I found was a huge struggle when working on my website,
      were my links. Specifically the links to the index/home, and blog home
      page. This was particularly scary to have to deal with seeing as they are
      a huge part of the website and if viewers cannot access my homepage, there
      is no website; similarly if they cannot access my blog home page they
      would not be able to view the contents of my blog posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this problem came about because initially, when I was setting up
      these links, I would only check their functionality through Live Server
      and not through my GitHub Repository. This gave me the impression that
      everything was working fine, additionally when starting out, I had no real
      understanding of root folders and how they worked. Meaning that I had
      failed to include the required folder when inserting the links.

    <h2>IxD Process:</h2>
    <h3>Discovering User Needs:</h3>
    <h3>Defining Interaction Patterns:</h3>
    <h3>Developing the Framework:</h3>
    <h3>Refining the Exprience:</h3>

    <h2>What I'm Proud of:</h2>
    <p>
      What I’m most proud of when it comes to my webpage is, admittedly, my blog
      page section. I’m very pleased with the way it is structured and how
      organized it is. I’ve added a return link within each blog post, that
      takes the viewer back to the Blog Home Page. I learnt about entities and
      used them for the arrows for the Return button. I’ve put a lot of thought
      and implemented a lot of my knowledge from class when building this
      section, and seeing all of that work present in these pages makes me
      really excited to see how it’ll look once I add other stylistic elements
      to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Change for the Future</h2>
    <p>
      I plan on implementing a more structured navigation bar. As of right now I
      feel as though my navigation is lacking in a lot of elements and like it
      isn’t really structured in a way that will help viewers efficiently
      navigate through my website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing that I would like to add onto my website is a lot more
      descriptions, especially on the Home Page, I feel like it would add a lot
      more personality to the website and for it to feel more personalised,
      along with that sent             iment, I think adding more images would help in
      achieving that goal
    </p>

    <h2>What I'd Like do Moving Forward:</h2>
    <p>
      Working on the structuring of HTML has taught me a lot of background
      knowledge on the importance of semantic markups and what it means for a
      website to be functional. What I’m excited about in the future is working
      with CSS. I'm looking forward to implementing a consistent colour scheme
      throughout my website, in order to bring more life and personality to my
      website. I think this would help elevate the website and help it move away
      the very structured look that HTML gives. Another thing I’m looking
      forward to when working with Java Script is adding animations and scroll
      buttons to my website. I think this would really help make the website a
      lot more interactive
