    <h2>Mapping Out My Site's Content, Experience, and Interface</h2>
    <p>
      How I would define my user alignment, and my goals for my website overall,
      is for it to be an accumulation of all my projects this whole semester. I
      want it to showcase every creative endeavor I decided to partake in this
      year; I would like for it to show my ability to critically analyze a piece
      of work through my essay writing pieces, and blog posts. What I want users
      to see in my webpage is an aspiring animator/writers portfolio, I want my
      web portfolio to be an extension of myself in terms of how much time and
      effort I put into making sure that it is, both, decorated & styled but
      also practical and functional. I want for it to almost resemble the
      funkiness and whimsiness of the webpages in the 2000's, some examples of
      this would be:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://00s.myretrotvs.com/#">My Retro TV</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/cartoon-network-2003">Cartoon Network (2003)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/cartoon-network-in-2005">Cartoon Network (2005)</a></li>
      </ul>
