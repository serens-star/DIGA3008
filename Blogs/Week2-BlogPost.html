    <h2>Moulthrop’s Essay & How it Speaks to the Interenet Today</h2>
    <body>
      <p>
        Moulthrop’s essay, ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the
        Laws of Media’ speaks directly to the evolution of the internet today,
        even though it was written before the modern web took shape. His essay
        discusses hypertext as a revolutionary medium that was expected to upend
        traditional information hierarchies, decentralize authority, and create
        a more democratic exchange of ideas. Moulthrop notes that early
        hypertext theorists like Ted Nelson envisioned a dynamic, open, and
        participatory network. However, instead of a decentralized utopia, large
        corporations (Yahoo, CNN, etc.) become the dominant sources of
        information. Today this is even more relevant with tech giants like
        Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple being in charge of a large majority of
        people’s personal information. The internet is no longer the free, open
        space early pioneers imagined, but rather a tightly managed corporate
        landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moulthrop also discusses how hypertext was supposed to liberate readers
        from linear, book-like experiences and empower them to create their own
        pathways of knowledge. While the internet offers interconnected
        information, a lot of it is algorithmically curated, which limits
        genuine exploration. Instead of purely text-based exploration, the
        internet today is dominated by multimedia-video content, gaming and
        immersive digital experiences, Moulthrop foreshadows this shift, by
        mentioning MP3 swapping, multiplayer games, and instant messaging as
        early examples of how hypertext would evolve beyond just textual links
      </p>
      <p>
        Moulthrop’s insights remain strikingly relevant today. The internet has
        followed the trajectory he predicted, because instead of breaking away
        from traditional power structures, it has often reinforced them. While
        hypertext and digital media have transformed communication, they have
        also been co-opted by economic and political forces. His work encourages
        a critical reflection on whether today’s internet is truly revolutionary
        or just a continuation of systems in new forms.

      <h2>Folder Structure & URL Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        What I'm hoping for in the first phase of my website is for it to be
        simple and functional. Eventually, as I get more comfortable with the
        coding languages, I want my website to be a lot more vibrant and
        animated. I want it to be reminiscent of cartoon websites in the early
        2ooo's. I would like my webpage portfolio to be representative of my
        creative passions, whilst also being functional, well-structured and
        organized. I want all my folders to be organized very neatly with clearly lables so I am able to effeciently reference them later on. Here is an example of this:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../Blogs/Images/FolderStructure.png" alt="Image showing the folder structure of the website." width="200" height="250"> 
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../Blogs/Images/ExtendedFolderStructure.png" alt="Image showing the opened folders from the folder structure of the website ." width="200" height="300"> 
          </div>
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I separated the folders into eight sections: Index (Home Page), Blogs, Essays, Design, Portfolio, Images, Styles, and Scripts. As I mentioned above I organized them this way so I would be able to easily reference these folders at a later stage. Furthermore, I had separated the blog folder into separate pages containing its own blog post, and this was done as to not have the viewer be bombarded with loads of words on one singular page. I thought this would make navigating through my website a lot easier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I also added an image folder into my blog folder (and in the future, others) just so I am able to track all my images on one page, ensuring that none of my images are all over the place and therefore, easy to refernce.      
      </p>

      <h2>wireframes</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="../Blogs/Images/AllWireframesOnOnePage.png" alt="Image showing the wireframe of the initial phase of the website" width="650" height="400">
      </figure>
      <p>
        What I had planned was for my Home page to include a brief introduction of myself and what its about. I also want to include links to the other folders on my navigation bar, as well an image of myself so the audiece has an idea of what the web developer looks like. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For my blog page I envisioned the audience be taken to this page, where at first, they are taken to the blog homepage where they are met with links of all the blog posts. The user would have to click the link so they are able to see the rest of the blog posts. The Essay, Portfolio and Design folders would work the same way.
